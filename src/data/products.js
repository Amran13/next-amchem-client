                "Flavophospholipol inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by interfering with murein (peptidoglycan) biosynthesis. The molecule mimics the natural substrate of the glycosyltransferase/transglycosylase enzymes of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), thereby blocking elongation of murein polysaccharide chains.\n\nInhibition of murein synthesis weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to osmotic lysis. Animal cells are unaffected as they lack murein-containing structures. The antimicrobial activity of flavophospholipol is directed primarily against Gram-positive bacteria of economic importance present in the gastrointestinal tract, including species of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Clostridium perfringens, and Enterococcus faecalis. The compound shows limited activity against certain Gram-negative organisms such as Pasteurella and Brucella species. Importantly, flavophospholipol does not significantly affect beneficial intestinal bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, thereby allowing early establishment and maintenance of a healthy gut microflora."

                "Bacitracin methylene disalicylate is a cyclic polypeptide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by blocking the dephosphorylation of C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate, also known as bactoprenol pyrophosphate. This lipid carrier molecule is essential for the transport of peptidoglycan precursors across the bacterial cell membrane. Inhibition of this process prevents proper cell wall formation, leading to bacterial growth suppression and cell death. The methylene disalicylate component enhances the stability of bacitracin and contributes additional anti-inflammatory effects through modulation of prostaglandin synthesis, thereby supporting intestinal integrity and reducing inflammatory responses.\n\nThe antimicrobial activity of bacitracin methylene disalicylate is directed predominantly against Gram-positive bacteria of economic importance in animal production. These include Clostridium species, Streptococcus suis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, as well as certain actinomycetes and spirillae. Activity against Gram-negative organisms is limited. The compound exhibits minimal impact on beneficial intestinal microflora, allowing maintenance of a stable gut ecosystem while pathogenic bacteria remain susceptible even after decades of use."

              content:
                "Lincomycin exerts its antibacterial effect by binding to the 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit at the peptidyl transferase center. This binding inhibits peptide bond formation and blocks elongation of the growing protein chain, thereby suppressing bacterial protein synthesis. At therapeutic concentrations, the effect is primarily bacteriostatic, while bactericidal activity may occur at higher concentrations depending on the susceptibility of the organism and bacterial load. This mode of action explains its effectiveness in controlling enteric and systemic infections as well as its performance-enhancing effects in food-producing animals.\n\nLincomycin shows excellent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus species, Clostridium perfringens, and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. It is also highly active against Mycoplasma species. In addition, lincomycin demonstrates activity against certain Gram-negative and anaerobic organisms of clinical relevance in livestock, including Lawsonia intracellularis and Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. Beneficial intestinal microflora such as Lactobacillus species are minimally affected at recommended inclusion levels."

                "After oral administration, lincomycin hydrochloride is partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with an oral bioavailability of approximately 20 to 30 percent. This allows the product to exert both local antimicrobial activity in the intestinal lumen and systemic effects following absorption. Lincomycin is widely distributed throughout body tissues, including bone, where it reaches therapeutically effective concentrations. The drug is excreted primarily via feces as unchanged compound and to a lesser extent through urine as metabolites."

                "AMCHEM LINCOMYCIN® PREMIX is indicated for the treatment and control of important enteric and systemic bacterial diseases in swine and poultry. In poultry, it is used for the prevention and control of necrotic enteritis caused or complicated by Clostridium species and for improvement of growth rate and feed conversion. In swine, it is indicated for the treatment and control of swine dysentery caused by Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, proliferative enteropathy associated with Lawsonia intracellularis, mycoplasmal infections including enzootic pneumonia, and for improving growth performance and feed efficiency. Use of AMCHEM LINCOMYCIN® PREMIX results in reduced incidence of post-weaning diarrhea, improved intestinal integrity, and suppression of pathogenic bacterial populations while maintaining beneficial gut flora. These effects contribute to improved nutrient absorption, better feed conversion efficiency, increased weight gain, and improved flock or herd uniformity. In poultry, the product supports control of necrotic enteritis and enhances early performance, while in swine it reduces intestinal damage and productivity losses associated with enteric and respiratory infections."

                "AMVIT-C STABLE® is classified as a vitamin supplement. Vitamin C is an essential water-soluble vitamin with broad physiological functions. It acts as a potent antioxidant by donating electrons and scavenging free radicals, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage. Vitamin C is a critical cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase enzymes involved in collagen synthesis, supporting bone strength, vascular integrity, skin health, and eggshell quality.\n\nVitamin C also plays an important role in immune function by enhancing leukocyte activity, supporting antibody production, and modulating inflammatory responses. It contributes to stress adaptation by supporting adrenal cortex function and regulating cortisol secretion. Additionally, vitamin C enhances iron absorption by reducing ferric iron to the more bioavailable ferrous form. The L-ascorbate 2-monophosphate form is enzymatically cleaved in vivo, releasing active ascorbic acid at the tissue level."

                "After oral administration, L-ascorbate 2-monophosphate is absorbed in the small intestine and hydrolyzed to free ascorbic acid. Vitamin C is widely distributed to body tissues, particularly those with high metabolic activity. Excess amounts are rapidly excreted via urine, and no tissue accumulation occurs, supporting a wide margin of safety.\n\nResearch published in Nature and related journals demonstrates that L-ascorbate 2-monophosphate retains 85–95% potency after feed pelleting at temperatures up to 90 °C and during extended storage, compared with only 20–40% retention for conventional ascorbic acid. Multiple studies show that vitamin C supplementation during periods of stress—such as heat stress, disease challenge, vaccination, transport, and weaning—significantly improves immune response, reduces cortisol levels, and helps maintain growth and production performance. In poultry, supplementation improves eggshell quality, reduces stress-related production drops, and enhances heat tolerance. In swine, vitamin C reduces weaning stress, improves growth performance, and supports carcass quality. In aquaculture species, dietary vitamin C is essential due to the inability of fish and shrimp to synthesize it endogenously."

Vitamins A, D₃, and E regulate immune competence, epithelial integrity, calcium and phosphorus metabolism, bone mineralization, and antioxidant protection of cell membranes. B-complex vitamins, including riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, folic acid, and biotin, play central roles in carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism, redox reactions, DNA synthesis, and cellular proliferation.\n\nMethionine and lysine are limiting essential amino acids in many feed formulations and are fundamental for efficient protein synthesis, muscle and feather development, nitrogen balance, and overall growth performance. Adequate and balanced provision of these nutrients improves appetite, feed conversion efficiency, stress tolerance, and productive performance across species."

                "AMCHEM ORMIN-G® is classified as a nutritional supplement providing organic trace minerals. Its activity is based on enhanced intestinal absorption, improved tissue utilization, and reduced antagonistic interactions commonly associated with inorganic mineral sources.\n\nChelation or organic complexation with amino acids, peptides, or organic ligands protects trace minerals from binding with phytate, fiber, and other dietary antagonists across varying gastrointestinal pH conditions. These complexes are absorbed efficiently through amino acid transport mechanisms in the intestinal epithelium, resulting in higher bioavailability and improved retention in target tissues such as liver, bone, skin, and feathers.\n\nIron supports oxygen transport and cellular respiration; zinc participates in more than 300 enzymatic systems essential for growth, immunity, and tissue repair; copper is required for iron utilization, connective tissue integrity, and antioxidant defense; manganese supports skeletal development, metabolic pathways, and reproductive performance; selenium functions as a critical component of antioxidant enzymes and thyroid hormone metabolism; and cobalt is essential for vitamin B₁₂ synthesis in ruminants. Collectively, these minerals support optimal metabolic efficiency, immune competence, reproductive performance, and product quality."

Monocalcium phosphate dissociates efficiently in the gastrointestinal tract, releasing phosphate ions that are readily absorbed and utilized for metabolic and structural functions.\n\nThe relatively high phosphorus and lower calcium content of MCP allows nutritionists to meet phosphorus requirements without oversupplying calcium. This is particularly important in high-producing layers, young animals with precise mineral needs, and diets containing multiple calcium sources. Adequate phosphorus supply supports skeletal mineralization, cellular energy transfer, nucleic acid synthesis, and normal metabolic regulation."

Utilization is influenced by dietary Ca:P ratio, vitamin D₃ status, age, and production stage. Absorbed minerals are incorporated into bone and other tissues, with excess excreted through normal regulatory mechanisms.\n\nNutritional studies demonstrate that monocalcium phosphate provides one of the highest phosphorus digestibility rates among inorganic phosphate sources, typically ranging from 80–90% in poultry and swine. Research confirms efficient incorporation of phosphorus from MCP into the bone mineral matrix, supporting skeletal strength and development. The use of MCP facilitates accurate mineral formulation and helps prevent disorders associated with phosphorus deficiency or mineral imbalance."

Its mode of action combines enzymatic degradation of mycotoxins with physical adsorption and gut health support.\n\nFollowing ingestion, Bacillus subtilis spores germinate in the gastrointestinal tract and produce a range of detoxifying enzymes, including lactonohydrolases and esterases. These enzymes cleave and modify the chemical structures of certain mycotoxins, particularly aflatoxin B₁ and zearalenone, converting them into less toxic metabolites that pose reduced risk to the animal. In addition to direct detoxification, Bacillus subtilis competes with toxigenic fungi for ecological niches, produces antimicrobial compounds that inhibit fungal growth, supports the establishment of beneficial gut microbiota, enhances intestinal barrier integrity, and modulates immune responses.\n\nYeast cell wall components provide complementary mycotoxin binding capacity for toxins that escape enzymatic degradation, while montmorillonite contributes strong adsorption of aflatoxins through electrostatic interactions. The combined biological and adsorptive mechanisms result in effective, broad-spectrum mycotoxin control without compromising nutrient availability."

                "AMCHEM TOXIN BINDER® is classified as a mycotoxin adsorbent. Its activity is based on the strong adsorption properties of aluminosilicate clay minerals with a layered structure and extensive surface area. The negatively charged surfaces of HSCAS and bentonite attract and bind positively charged regions of mycotoxins, particularly aflatoxins, through electrostatic interactions and physical entrapment within the clay matrix. Once bound, the mycotoxin–clay complex remains stable throughout the gastrointestinal tract and prevents intestinal absorption of the toxins. The bound toxins are subsequently excreted via feces without being released back into the digestive system.\n\nThe inclusion of yeast cell wall components provides supplementary binding support for additional mycotoxin classes and contributes to overall gut health. By reducing the toxic load entering systemic circulation, AMCHEM TOXIN BINDER® helps protect liver function, immune competence, and productive performance."

Its activity is derived from the synergistic functions of mannan-oligosaccharides and β-glucans present in yeast cell walls. Mannan-oligosaccharides bind pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Proteus, and Klebsiella that express mannose-specific lectins on their surface. By binding these pathogens, MOS prevents their attachment and colonization in the intestinal tract, facilitating their removal through normal digestive processes. This reduction in pathogen load supports intestinal integrity and lowers the incidence of enteric infections.\n\nβ-glucans act primarily as modulators of the innate immune system. They activate immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells through pattern-recognition receptors including Dectin-1 and complement receptor-3. "

                "AMCHEM ACID® is classified as a feed acidifier and antimicrobial agent. Its primary mode of action is based on the antimicrobial activity of formic acid. In its undissociated form, formic acid penetrates bacterial cell membranes and dissociates inside the cytoplasm, leading to a reduction in intracellular pH. This disrupts essential metabolic enzymes, interferes with DNA synthesis, and inhibits bacterial growth, with particular effectiveness against gram-negative pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella species.\n\nIn addition to its antimicrobial effects, AMCHEM ACID® enhances digestive efficiency by lowering gastric pH, thereby increasing pepsin activity and improving protein digestion and amino acid absorption. Feed acidification also reduces buffering capacity of the diet, supports the growth of beneficial lactic acid–producing bacteria, and contributes to a more stable intestinal environment.\n\nFormic acid further improves mineral availability by maintaining minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, zinc, and iron in soluble form, preventing precipitation in the small intestine and enhancing absorption."

When absorbed, formic acid is rapidly metabolized through normal biochemical pathways and does not accumulate in animal tissues. No residues in edible products are expected when used as directed. Scientific studies have demonstrated that dietary formic acid supplementation significantly reduces post-weaning diarrhea in piglets, improves growth performance, and lowers pathogenic E. coli populations. Additional research has shown that dietary acidification enhances mineral absorption and overall nutrient utilization. The buffered form provided by ammonium formate maintains antimicrobial efficacy while improving safety and handling characteristics."

                "AMCHEM ACID-LIQ® is classified as a feed acidifier with potent antimicrobial activity. Its primary action is derived from formic acid, which penetrates bacterial cell membranes in its undissociated form and dissociates within the cytoplasm, causing intracellular acidification and disruption of essential metabolic enzymes and DNA synthesis. This mechanism is particularly effective against gram-negative pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella species.\n\nIn addition to antimicrobial effects, AMCHEM ACID-LIQ® enhances digestive efficiency by lowering gastric pH, thereby improving pepsin activity, protein digestion, and amino acid absorption. Reduction of feed buffering capacity supports a more favorable gut environment for beneficial lactic acid-producing bacteria. The acidic environment also maintains mineral solubility, preventing precipitation in the small intestine and improving absorption of calcium, phosphorus, zinc, and iron. Ammonium formate provides a buffered source of formic acid, reducing corrosivity while maintaining biological efficacy."

Formic acid is rapidly metabolized through normal physiological pathways and does not accumulate in tissues. No residues are expected in edible animal products when the product is used according to recommended application rates.\n\nResearch published in PNAS demonstrates that dietary formic acid supplementation in weaned piglets significantly reduces post-weaning diarrhea, improves growth performance, and lowers intestinal populations of pathogenic E. coli. Additional studies reported in Nature Communications confirm that dietary acidification enhances mineral absorption, including calcium, phosphorus, zinc, and iron, contributing to improved skeletal development and overall productivity."
